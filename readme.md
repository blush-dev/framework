# Blush CMS/Framework

Blush is a flat-file system (_can we really call this hot mess a CMS?_) for creating super basic websites.  This is the source for the framework.  It is under super-duper-crazy-heavy development at the moment. So, you know, don't run this in production.

To test it, install the `blush-dev/blush` repo.

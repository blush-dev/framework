# Roadmap

| # | Milestone | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | **Setup.** Clear 1.x `src/` on `2.x`. New `composer.json` (MIT, PHP 8.5, PSR interface packages, dev tools, `x3p0-skills`). `.phpcs.xml` (modeled on x3p0-breadcrumbs, no WordPress rules, 8.5). PHPStan (max). PHPUnit. CI. DDEV on 8.5. | The empty project passes lint, analysis, and tests on 8.5 |
| M1 | **Core.** Copy and adapt the x3p0-framework container and application, x3p0-event, and x3p0-class-registry/attributes, with their tests. Add `Paths`, `Env`, config objects, errors, log, and clock. | The copied tests pass under `Blush\` on 8.5 |
| M2 | **HTTP + Console.** PSR-7/17/15 implementations, `Kernel`, `Emitter`, the console framework, and `serve`. | "Hello" is served in the browser, through `Kernel::handle()` in tests, and via `bin/blush` |
| M3 | **Routing.** Compiler, matcher, URL generator, attribute discovery, redirects, and `routes:list`. | 404, 405, and redirects are tested; the route cache works |
| M4 | **Content.** Source, parsers (behind interfaces), schemas, indexer, repository, query, `content:*` commands, and media. | jtcom's ~1,200 entries index and lint cleanly; query benchmarks are recorded |
| M5 | **Views + theming.** Engine, hierarchy, components, `Head`, tokens, theme loader, default theme, built-in controllers, feeds, and sitemaps. | The default theme renders every route type |
| M6 | **Caching + publishing.** Cache layers, content version, `PageCache`, webhook, and `publish`. | One-command publish and cache clear |
| M7 | **Static export.** `build` plus incremental mode. | jtcom exports and serves from static files |
| M8 | **Port jtcom.** jtcom theme, config, `user/` layout, a URL-parity crawl against the live site, and a redirect map. | Every old URL returns 200 or 301; deployed |
| M9 | **Admin stage 2:** operations dashboard. | Publish, clear, reindex, and export from a browser |
| M10 | **Admin stage 3:** editor and media library. | Create and edit entries in a browser |
| Later | `SqliteIndex` + search; in-house YAML and Markdown parsers; theme distribution; custom template engine | — |
